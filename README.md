# DISCLAIMER

The instructions and tools provided are best effort and were tested on the specific devices I purchased. Future hardware
and software revisions may cause problems, and maybe even break your camera (unlikely!). If your device doesn't flash as expected,
please file a bug with details or better yet, join our Discord and we can help diagnose it together. This is a hobbyist project
and no warranty is implied.

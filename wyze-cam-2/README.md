# Wyze Cam V2 (WYZEC2)

This was a popular model for a long tiem and while I don't recommend buying a new one today, lots of folks already have them and they are plentiful in the used market.

# Installation Steps

1. Format your SD card to fat32 (not exfat!)
2. Unzip the contents of wyze-v2.zip to the root of the sd card
3. Download the latest thingino image for the wyze c2 from https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/releases/tag/firmware
4. Rename the firmware to autoupdate-full.bin and place in the root of the sd card
5. Cleanly unmount the sd card and put into the sd slot on the bottom of the camera
6. Hold down the reset button while plugging in, continue to hold until the statis light turns blue, about 5 seconds.
7. Wait around 10 minutes and you should see the camera's new wireless network for provisioning it

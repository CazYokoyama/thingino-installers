# Wyze Cam V2 (WYZEC2) and NEOS SmartCam

This was a popular model for a long tiem and while I don't recommend buying a new one today, lots of folks already have them and they are plentiful in the used market.

# Installation Steps

1. Format your SD card to fat32 (not exfat!)
2. Unzip the contents of wyze-cam-2.zip to the root of the sd card
3. Download both Thingino firmware images for the Wyze Cam 2 and place them on the sd card. You can get them at https://thingino.com/
4. Cleanly unmount the sd card and put into the sd slot on the bottom of the camera
5. Hold down the reset button while plugging in, continue to hold until the status light turns blue, about 5 seconds.
6. If everything is correct, the process takes 6 minutes 45 seconds in my testing.
7. You should now see the camera's new wireless network for provisioning it.

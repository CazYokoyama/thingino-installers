# THIS PROCESS IS NOT REVERSIBLE

Using the ONE TOOL install method, it's a one-way street. You can always flash Thingino and other third party firmwares, but if you want the
option of reverting to the factory firmware you will need to take a backup using a flash programmer.

1. Download the jooan zip from this repo

3. Open Take the camera apart
4. Insert your SD card
5. Create a short on the spi flash chip pins 5 and 6
6. Power up the cam. Wait 1.5 seconds and remove the short.
7. Wait a minute and the camera will boot to Thingino.
